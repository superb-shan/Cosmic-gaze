# Intro

This was a continuation of my Disney+ Clone.
During the Second sem of my Cllege years (BE CSE) duration: Apr - Aug 2022
Our python instructor Dr. Summia Parveen Asst. Prof/CSE @ Sri Eshwar College of Engineering asked us to make any python project

# We a team of 4:

Shankar K
Shahana S
Saranya N
Swetha Raylene J

# Process

We decided to make a website, as I already had prior knowledge to make simple websites.
We collected info, pics, videos of the relevant data secretly as this project was supposed to be a surprise.
We used Pycharm and Django webframework to depoy our website as the project was supposed to be a python project eventhough it doesn't depend on python

1. There is index.html file which is the main and only page
2. And styles.css file which contains all the stylings
3. index.js This is an important file because it has the carausel and sliders used in the website.

There are only 2 moving parts in this websites which is coded in javascript and kept in index.js
